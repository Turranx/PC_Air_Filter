# PC Air Filter
An internal computer case air filter.

Pictures, parts list, build instructions, and installation instructions are found on [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/177933-pc-140mm-air-filter).

## File List:
- **Lid Spacer:** Sometimes if a print goes wrong or your measurements are off, you need a gap filler.
- **Hole Cover:** Covers the egress side of the fan.
- **Base Plate:** The Foundation.  Size of a 140mm fan.  Holds the air filter.
- **Pressure Plate:** Keeps the air filter pressed into the Base Plate.
- **Short Depth:** The pyramid design was getting in the way of my Supermicro ATX Power Supply project, so I had to flaten it out to make it fit.

## Quick Preview
This image shows a 92x38mm fan (top), an 80x32mm fan (middle), and a 70x32mm fan (bottom).  The '70 is the "Short Depth" model, and also includes a shroud to cover the hole in the Fractal Define S2 case.
